==============================

## v3.0.1 (2022-12-30)
- autocomplete should revert when entered value is not on the list

## v3.0.0 (2022-12-28)
- breaking change: `cssClass` property available on some components has been renamed to `className` (to be more aligned with the standard workaround in other libs/frameworks).
- some components (where possible) are now using `$$props` to pass-through the properties of the instance down to the component.


## v2.1.1 (2022-12-24)
- breaking change: `dist` folder has been renamed to `docs`, as this is the only allowed name for a GH pages folder so that the GH pages is published automatically (without writing a GH action specifically for this).



## v1.7.12
